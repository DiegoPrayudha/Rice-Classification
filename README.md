## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation can be found on Kaggle:
[Rice Image Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muratkokludataset/rice-image-dataset)

## Technologies Used
- **TensorFlow**: For building and training the machine learning model.
- **Google Colab**: For running the code and experiments.

## Approach
The project involves building a machine learning model to classify rice types. Two approaches were evaluated:
1. **Without Data Augmentation**: Using the raw dataset without any modifications.
2. **With Data Augmentation**: Applying various augmentation techniques to improve the model's performance and robustness.

## Result
The results comparing the model performance with and without data augmentation are documented in the notebook. You can observe how data augmentation impacts the classification accuracy and model robustness.
